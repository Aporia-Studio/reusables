# Resuables

A library to make website building process easier. Components here means

- Header
- Footer
- Hero Sections
- Testamonials
- Sliders
- Cards

and other various parts of a website. The idea was to copy paste or just call a component in a website and it should work.
Simple and sound. I do not want to use header1, header2, header3 so all the components will have names from rivers around the world.

More info will be added later.
